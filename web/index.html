			<p>Srtgears&#8482; is a subtitle engine for reading subtitle
				files, manipulating / transforming them and then saving the result
				into another file.</p>
			<p>Srtgears provides some very handy features which are not
				available in other subtitle tools, for example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>merge 2 subtitle files to have dual subs: one at the
					bottom, one at the top (this is not concatenation, but that's also
					supported)</li>
				<li>lengthen / shorten display duration of subtitles (if you're
					a slow reader, you're gonna appreciate this :))</li>
				<li>remove hearing impaired (HI) texts (such as "[PHONE
					RINGING]" or "(phone ringing)")</li>
				<li>strip off formatting (such as &lt;i&gt;, &lt;b&gt;,
					&lt;u&gt;, &lt;font&gt;)</li>
				<li>split the subtitle file at a specified time</li>
				<li>statistics from the subtitles</li>
				<li>etc...</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Presentation</h3>

			<p>The Srtgears engine is presented in 3 ways:</p>

			<h4>1. Command line tool</h4>
			<p>
				Srtgears is available as a <i>command line tool</i> for easy, fast,
				scriptable and repeatable usage.<br> Binary (compiled)
				distributions are available on the <a href="/download.html">Downloads</a>
				page.
			</p>

			<h4>2. Web interface: online web page</h4>
			<p>
				Srtgears can also be used on the web for those who do not want to
				download the tool just try it out from the browser. It can be found
				on the <a href="/srtgears-online.html">Srtgears online</a> page.
			</p>

			<h4>3. Srtgears engine: a Go package</h4>
			<p>
				And last (but not least) a Go package for developers. The engine was
				designed to be independent from the command line and web interfaces,
				its API is clear, well documented and easy-to-use.<br> To get
				the source code (along with the sources of the tool and web
				interface), documentation and more visit the source code repository:<br>
				<a href="https://github.com/icza/srtgears" target="_blank">https://github.com/icza/srtgears</a>
			</p>

			<h3 id="Limits">Limits</h3>
			<p>Input files must be UTF-8 encoded, output files will be UTF-8
				encoded as well.</p>
			<p>Supported input format is SubRip (*.srt) only, supported
				output formats are SubRip (*.srt) and Sub Station Alpha (*.ssa).</p>
			<p>
				It should also be noted that SubRip format specification does not
				include subtitle positioning. Srtgears uses an unofficial extension
				'{\anX}' which may not be supported by all video players, or some
				players interpret the position values differently. <a
					href="https://mpc-hc.org/" target="_blank">MPC-HC</a> has full
				support for it. In these cases the Sub Station Alpha output format
				is recommended (where the specification covers subtitle positioning
				/ alignment).
			</p>

			<h3>Story</h3>
			<p>
				Srtgears is started as a 48-hour work created for the <a
					href="http://gophergala.com/" target="_blank">Gopher Gala 2016</a>
				event. The initial version can be found <a href="https://github.com/gophergala2016/srtgears" target="_blank">here</a>. I was competing solo.
