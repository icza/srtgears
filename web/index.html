			<h2>Home</h2>
			<p>Srtgears&#8482; is a subtitle engine for reading subtitle
				files, manipulating / transforming them and then saving the result
				into another file.</p>
			<p>Srtgears provides some very handy features which are not
				available in other subtitle tools, for example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>merge 2 subtitle files to have dual subs: one at the
					bottom, one at the top (this is not concatenation, but that's also
					supported)</li>
				<li>lengthen / shorten display duration of subtitles (if you're
					a slow reader, you're gonna appreciate this :))</li>
				<li>remove hearing impaired texts (such as "[PHONE RINGING]" or
					"(phone ringing)")</li>
				<li>strip off formatting (such as &lt;i&gt;, &lt;b&gt;,
					&lt;u&gt;, &lt;font&gt;)</li>
				<li>statistics from the subtitles</li>
				<li>etc...</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Presentation</h3>
			<p>The Srtgears engine is presented in 3 ways:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Srtgears is available as a <i>command line tool</i> for
					easy, fast, scriptable and repeatable usage.<br> Binary
					(compiled) distributions are available on the <a
					href="/download.html">Downloads</a> page.
				</li>
				<li>Web interface: <i>online web page</i><br> Srtgears can
					also be used on the web for those who do not want to download the
					tool just it out from the browser. It can be found on the <a
					href="/download.html">Srtgears online</a> page.
				</li>
				<li>Srtgears engine: a <i>Go package</i> (for developers)<br>
					And last (but not least) a Go package for developers. The engine
					was designed to be independent from the command line and web
					interfaces, its API is clear, well documented and easy-to-use.<br>
					To get the source code (along with the sources of the tool and web
					interface), documentation and more visit the source code
					repository:<br> <a
					href="https://github.com/gophergala2016/srtgears" target="_blank">https://github.com/gophergala2016/srtgears</a>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Limits</h3>
			<p>Input files must be UTF-8 encoded, output files will be UTF-8
				encoded as well.</p>
			<p>Supported input format is SubRip (*.srt) only, supported
				output formats are SubRip (*.srt) and Sub Station Alpha (*.ssa).</p>
			<p>
				It should also be noted that SubRip format specification does not
				include subtitle positioning. Srtgears uses an unofficial extension
				'{\anX}' which may not be supported by all video players, or some
				players interpret the position values differently. <a
					href="https://mpc-hc.org/" target="_blank">MPC-HC</a> has full
				support for it. In these cases the Sub Station Alpha output format
				is recommended (where the specification covers subtitle positioning
				/ alignment).
			</p>

			<h3>Story</h3>
			<p>
				Srtgears is a 48-hour work created for the <a
					href="http://gophergala.com/" target="_blank">Gopher Gala 2016</a>
				event. I was competing solo.
